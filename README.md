# -Event-Based-Ws28XX-Controller

24 keys with presets and chases 
Tasks are handled with TaskManager software 
#include <TaskManagerIO.h>
https://www.thecoderscorner.com/products/arduino-libraries/taskmanager-io/task-manager-scheduling-guide/

Keys are responsive with little latency 
Events are working smoothly 
presets and chases are working but will be improved overtime (My OCD)

Next step is to incorporate four faders 4 controlling RGB and chase speed.

Cheers
